#  Employee Salary Prediction Project

This is a **Machine Learning + Flask web application** that predicts an employee’s salary based on multiple factors such as age, gender, department, job title, years of experience, and education level.  

The project demonstrates the full cycle of:
1. Data preprocessing and model training  
2. Model deployment using Flask  
3. Interactive web pages for salary prediction and history tracking
